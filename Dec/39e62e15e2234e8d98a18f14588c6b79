Transnet has cleared up and reopened its Saldanha iron ore export channel, it announced on Monday morning. The freight rail entity said the channel had been reopened two days earlier than expected, after initial reports that this would take at least two weeks. Transnet shut down the iron ore plant in Saldanha after a truck collided with a bridge in the facility, which shifted the bridge and "compromised its integrity". It was also closed temporarily in September for maintenance purposes. The statement said nine days after the incident, a newly constructed temporary steel bridge passed all technical assessments and the line was now open for business. "The temporary structure was built in readily available modular sections, which could be compiled to meet any bridge span and load bearing required in the event of an emergency. "Some of the state-of-the-art applications were the casting of cement blocks for the elevation of the temporary bridge structure," said the statement. Transnet chief business development officer Gert de Beer said the company did well to brief its customers at the iron ore line regularly until the damage was clear, as well as to set up a temporary structure ahead of schedule. "When the incident took place, the first people we involved were customers. Our engagement meant that we gave updates on all the developments in getting the line re-opened and operational," said De Beer. It is estimated that 27 million tonnes of cargo have been carried through the facility in the 2017-18 financial year alone.
