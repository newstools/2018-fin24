Police are investigating a case of sabotage after the Richards Bay coal export rail line was on Thursday cut in half with a blow torch, causing the derailment of 51 wagons carrying coal. The 51 wagons were part of a jumbo 200 wagon coal train headed for Richards Bay Coal Terminal. Transnet, in a statement on Friday, said that no one was injured in the derailment and there was no environmental impact. The rail agency's spokesperson Mike Asefovitz told Fin24 that Transnet has declared force majeure on the coal shipment, meaning unforeseeable circumstances prevented it from fulfilling its contract. Asefovitz said Transnet engineers were working to repair the cut lines by Saturday.
