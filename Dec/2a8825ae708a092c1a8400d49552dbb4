Now, the billionaire may be about to bring his Tesla electric cars back home.“Probably end of next year,” the chief executive officer of Tesla replied to a South African fan on Twitter, who asked him when a store would open in the country of the businessman’s birth. “Amazing - I’m first in line when it happens!” replied the individual. Tesla has stores across the globe, including the US, Germany, China and Australia. But it has none in Africa, which has been broadly left out of the electric-car revolution Tesla pioneered. Lower average incomes and poor power infrastructure mean petrol-powered cars - often bought second hand - dominate most markets on the continent.South Africa is Africa’s most industrialised economy, but it’s not immune to those challenges. Cash constraints and delayed power plants at state utility Eskom have led to rolling blackouts.
