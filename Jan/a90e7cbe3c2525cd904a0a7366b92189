Bangkok - Thailand received a record number of foreign tourists for a single month as a boom in arrivals continues. Arrivals jumped almost 16% in December from a year earlier to an 
unprecedented 3.5 million, the Tourism Ministry’s Permanent Secretary 
Pongpanu Svetarundra said in a briefing in Bangkok on Tuesday. He 
predicted a fresh high in January amid the traditional peak season for 
tourism. "We will continue to keep breaking records," Pongpanu said. Pongpanu said the government is targeting 37 million visitors in 2018
 and 3 trillion baht ($94bn) of revenue from domestic and foreign 
tourists combined. That would be worth more than a fifth of the 

economy - and put ever greater strain on congested airports as well as 
Bangkok’s packed roads and metro system. Tourism and exports have contributed to an acceleration in economic 
growth in the military-run country, as well as an appreciation in its 
currency. The 

baht has strengthened more than 2% against the dollar this year, 
one of the strongest performers in Asia, prompting concern that the 
climb will eventually harm competitiveness in Southeast Asia’s 
second-largest economy. * Sign up to Fin24's top news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO FIN24 NEWSLETTER
