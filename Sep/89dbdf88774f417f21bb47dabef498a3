Thailand’s central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged near a
 record low as expected, with the prospect of a future tightening 
increasing as more monetary policy committee members dissented. Five of the seven committee members at the meeting voted to hold the 
one-day bond repurchase 

rate at 1.5%, where it’s been since 2015, according to the Bank 
of Thailand’s statement on Wednesday. Two voted for an increase to 1.75%, compared to just 
one in the June and August meetings. “The committee viewed that the monetary policy should remain 
accommodative although the need for currently accommodative monetary 
policy would be gradually reduced,” the central bank said in the 
statement. Most central banks in Southeast Asia have raised rates this year to 
help support currencies caught in the contagion sweeping across emerging
 markets. While Thailand’s hefty foreign reserves and a 
current-account surplus have helped to shield the nation against the 
worst of the 
volatility, policy makers are laying the groundwork for rate hikes as 
inflation picks up. What Bloomberg economists say... Twenty one of 24 economists 

surveyed by Bloomberg predicted the decision, with three forecasting a quarter-point hike. Inflation accelerated to 1.62% last month, the fastest pace since
 2014. The central bank’s target is an annual average inflation rate of 1% to 4% for this year. The currency is the 
only gainer against the dollar in Asia this quarter. The central bank retained its economic growth forecast for this year 
at 4.4%, and at 4.2% for 2019. The inflation estimate was 
kept at 1.1% for 2018, while the forecast for next year was cut 
to 1.1%. Economic expansion slowed to 4.6% in the second quarter from a 
five-year high of 4.9% in the previous three months. The trade 
outlook is key as exports of goods and services are equivalent to about 
two-thirds of gross domestic product.
