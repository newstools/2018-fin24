An indie Taiwanese hacker has proclaimed he’ll broadcast an
attempt to wipe out Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook page this Sunday – live. Self-professed bug bounty-hunter Chang Chi-yuan, who ferrets
out software flaws in return for cash, says he’ll live-stream an endeavor to
delete the billionaire’s account at 06:00 local time from his own Facebook
page. He didn’t get into details or respond to an online query. “Broadcasting the deletion of FB founder Zuck’s account,”
the lanky youngster, who turns 24 this year based on past interviews, told his
26 000-plus followers on Facebook this week. “Scheduled to go live.” Cyber-enthusiasts from India to the US routinely expose
loopholes in corporate websites and software, earning small financial rewards.
It’s unusual however for so-called white-hat hackers to do so in real time. Chang, a minor celebrity at home who’s gone on talk shows to
discuss his exploits, was reportedly sued by a local bus operator after
infiltrating their systems and buying a ticket for just NT$1 (about 46 cents). He’s published a gamut of claims – none of which could be
independently verified – including attacks on Apple and Tesla And his Facebook
account was listed among eight “special contributors” in Line Corporation’s 2016
bug-hunters’ hall of fame. Facebook, which like many Silicon Valley giants runs a
thriving bug-bounty program, didn’t immediately respond to a request for
comment outside business hours. The social media company is under the gun on a
host of issues from privacy to its handling of election interference and hate
speech, and can ill-afford trouble with basic cybersecurity. “I don’t want to be a proper hacker, and I don’t even want
to be a hacker at all,” Chang said in a recent post. “I’m just bored and try to
dabble so that I can earn some money.” * Sign up to Fin24's top news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO FIN24 NEWSLETTER
