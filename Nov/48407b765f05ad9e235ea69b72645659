house-price growth dropped below 2% for the first time in five years, according to Nationwide Building Society. In what it said was a “relatively subdued” market, average values 
rose 1.6% in October compared with a year earlier. That’s the 
weakest increase since mid-2013. Nationwide reiterated its forecast for prices to rise about 1% this year. The report on Thursday is more evidence Britain’s housing market is 
weakening after decades of booming prices. Stretched affordability is 
partly behind the pullback, while Brexit has created additional 
uncertainty about the economic outlook. The Bank of England, which 
announces a 
policy decision at noon in London, says any interest-rate increases over
 the next few years will be limited and gradual as it lifts borrowing 
costs from historical lows. “The squeeze on household budgets and the uncertain economic outlook 
is likely to have dampened demand, even though borrowing costs remain 
low by historic standardsand unemployment is at 40-year lows,” said 

Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist.
