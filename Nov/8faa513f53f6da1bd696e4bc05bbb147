The Public Servants Association (PSA) said in a statement on Wednesday that it strongly condemned the reduction of wages for security officers employed by Isidingo Security Services to guard Transnet's rail network in areas north of Pretoria. According to the PSA statement, the employees' salaries were reduced from R4 100 a month to R3 600. The PSA claims this was done "allegedly without any consultation with workers owing to an alleged error". "A reduction of R500 per month is drastic, especially under the current economic times. This situation also underlined the value of effective workers representation to ensure that issues such as these are dealt with as soon as possible to find solutions and prevent hardship," said PSA general manager Ivan Fredericks. "Progress is being made to ensure minimum wages and it is, therefore, distressing that the new rating by Isidingo Security Services is lower than the proposed minimum wage." The matter has been referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration. * Sign up to Fin24's top news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO FIN24 NEWSLETTER
