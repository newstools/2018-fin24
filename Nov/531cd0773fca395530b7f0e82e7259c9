Google announced the winners of the first Google Impact Challenge South Africa. Twelve non-profits and social enterprises were each awarded a share of $2m in grant funding.Â The four winners - Corruption Watch BUA MZANSI; Gradesmatch; MeMeZa (People's Choice award); and RLabs receive $250 000 each, while the eight runners up will each receive $125 000. The funding will be allocated in tranches, to be assigned to each enterprise as they reach a set of predefined milestones specific to each venture. In addition to the funding, the winners and runners up also receive support from Google to reach their goals and meet those milestones. Google Impact Challenge Africa, a competition to find the most innovative African non-profits and social enterprises using technology to solve societal problems, opened in May and more than 1 300 entries were received in South Africa. According to Google South Africa public affairs and communications head Mich Atagana, many African innovators are doing great work with real impact and Google is keen to shine a light on their work and also give a financial boost to their projects and ideas.
